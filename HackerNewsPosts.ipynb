    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) (HN) is a website where user submitted posts are voted and commented upon, very much like [Reddit](https://reddit.com).\n",
    "In this website we are particularly interested in posts where their respective titles begin with `Ask HN` or `Show HN`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users submit `Ask HN` posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question while `Show HN` posts are used to show the community a project, a product or something generally interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the dataset the description of the coloumns are as below (Index Numbers have been added so that we know what coloumn the codes below refer to):\n",

    "0| id          |The unique identifier from Hacker News for the post\n",
    "1|title       |The title of the post\n",
    "2| url         | The URL that the posts links to, if it the post has a URL\n",
    "3| num_points  | The number of points the post acquired, calculated as the total number of upvotes minus the total number of downvotes\n",
    "4| num_comments| The number of comments that were made on the post\n",
    "5|author      | The username of the person who submitted the post\n",
    "6|created_at  | The date and time at which the post was submitted \n",
    "\n",
    "The Dataset we are working with contains approximately 300,000 HN posts. Further information regarding the dataset used for this project can be found by clicking [here](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts).\n",

    "1. To determine whether 'Ask HN' Posts or 'Show HN' posts receive a higher number of comments on average.\n",
