# Hacker News Posts Analysis

Hacker News (HN) is a website where user submitted posts are voted and commented upon, very much like Reddit. In this website we are particularly interested in posts where their respective titles begin with Ask HN or Show HN.

Users submit Ask HN posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question while Show HN posts are used to show the community a project, a product or something generally interesting.

The main objective of this project is as below:

**Project Goals:**

* To determine whether 'Ask HN' Posts or 'Show HN' posts receive a higher number of comments on average.
* To determine the best time of day to submit your post in order to recieve a high number of comments.
